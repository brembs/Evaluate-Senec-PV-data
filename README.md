# Evaluate-Senec-PV-data
R-Script to evaluate CSV data from SENEC

If you own a SENEC.IES solar battery (http://www.senec-ies.com), you are receiving CSV files from SENEC with all your Photovoltaics data. You may want yearly statistics for your system and this is what this code does: it takes all the SENEC CSV files from one year (i.e., all files in a folder specified by the user) and computes basic summary statistics and saves them in two different graphs, a simple bar graph and a stacked graph that shows the relations between input and output.
